What is Paint 'N Run?

- Paint 'N Run is an amazing game made by amazing people (person). Its essentially an endless platformer inspired by Google's No Internet Dinsosaur game, and Greg Lobanov's game Chicory, where the main character must use the power of colors to solve puzzles and advance. 

How to Play:
- Objective: Survive.
- You control a lovely white square. Don't let that lovely white square die. The square is literally putting its life in your hands. 
- The lovely white square can only stand on filled tiles. A filled tile has a solid black border, while an unfilled tile will have a dashed border.
- The color of the dashed border represents the color of the tile. Selecting the corresponding paint selector will fill the unfilled tile. 
- Use the paint selector buttons to fill in any unfilled tiles so that our lovely white square doesn't fall. The best way to do this is to be airborne and fill in the tiles while the lovely white square is still in the air. 
- Also be on the lookout for menacing purple rectangles. These things are relentless and can also take out our lovely white square. Lucky for us, menacing purple rectangles can't jump and aren't that tall, so all you need to do is jump over them when they appear. 

Controls:
- Use "A" and "D" to move left and right
- Use "W" or spacebar to jump
- Use "J", "K", "L", ";" to change the background color and fill tiles (home row baby)
- Alternatively you can click the paint selector buttons to change the background color

How to Win?
- Winning is pretty subjective. 
- Some may consider simply opening this README.md file a win in it of itself.
- Others may consider jumping over a single menacing purple rectangle winning. 
- Its really up to you to decide what "Winning" looks like. Don't let anyone tell you otherwise. 
- That being said, a score of 1000 is pretty cool, and would probably impress all your friends.
